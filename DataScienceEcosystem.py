# ## Arithmetic Expressions Examples
# 
# Arithmetic expressions are fundamental in mathematics and programming. They involve mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Let's explore some common arithmetic expression examples:
# 
# ### Addition
# 
# Addition is the process of combining two or more numbers to find their total.
# 
# Example:
# ```plaintext
# 3 + 5 = 8
# 

# In[7]:


# Multiplication
num1 = 6
num2 = 3
product = num1 * num2
print(f"The product of {num1} and {num2} is {product}")

# Addition
num3 = 8
num4 = 5
sum_result = num3 + num4
print(f"The sum of {num3} and {num4} is {sum_result}")


# In[8]:


# Convert minutes to hours
minutes = 150
hours = minutes / 60
remainder_minutes = minutes % 60

print(f"{minutes} minutes is equal to {hours:.0f} hours and {remainder_minutes} minutes")
